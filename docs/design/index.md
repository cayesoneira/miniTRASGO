# Detector design

This section of design is dedicated to both hardware and software. We document the setup so it is known for future devices. Here we show the building blocks of the miniTRASGO, but also some important considerations on the system scheme, as well as a convention for a frame of reference. We want to be no ambiguous when sharing the results and discussions with the TRASGO colaboration.
