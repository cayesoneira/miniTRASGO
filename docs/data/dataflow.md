# Dataflow
The dataflow is made of several stages.

## TRB data retrieval and placement
1. The **TRB**, TRB3 from now on, sends its information through ethernet packets that are *floating* to the network.
2. From the Odroid SBC, the software **DABC** (Data Acquisition Backbone Core, it comes from GSI) takes those packages and stores them in `/media/externalDisk/hlds/` as `.hld` files, written in binary. They contain all the TRB information, not only rates but times (trailing and leading).
3. `CopyFiles` copies the `.hld` (only if there is more than one), also it is executing continously, to the `~/gate/system/devices/TRB3/data/daqData/rawData/dat`. This `CopyFiles` has many features and it is modifyable.

## Unpacking
4. **First step**. The `unpacker` is one of the key programs of the minGO datastream. It takes the `.hld` from its location, creates a temporary folder and uncompresses the `.hld` inside it. Then it processes it in a first step to be matlab readable into the directory `~/gate/system/devices/TRB3/data/daqData/rawData/mat`. This is a first matlab file that is not physics friendly, since it is written in the language the TRBs handle: epoch, coarse, fine times... **However, this can be interesting to study for some that are interested in a more raw analysis**.
5. **Second step**. The unpacker, then and automatically, in a second step that applies LUTs (LookUp Tables), builds the `.mat` that contains the time and charge in a very readable format and stores them in `~/gate/system/devices/TRB3/data/daqData/varData`; a small subroutine turns this info into ascii that will be stored in `~/gate/system/devices/TRB3/data/daqData/asci`. The unpacking is finished. Note: the unpacker starts to work only if there are two or more `.hld` files, and it can be run in parallel in several unpackings: this program just communicates with itself to share the unpacking. Also it is worth mentioning that the unpacker uses in a certain part `daq_anal` to convert the `.hld` from binary to hexadecimal.

The unpacker output is called like this `minI23202060708.dat` where there is a date code: `minI_23 202_06_07_08.dat` `minI<YY><DDD><HH:MM:SS>`, `DDD` is the day of the year counting up to 365.

## Automatic ancillary analysis and distribution
6. Now the automatic analysis begins: each 5 s the `ana.sh`, which is in `~/gate/software/ana`, is executed. It calculates for each plane and for the telescope as a whole a lot of parameters. As before, there have to be two or more files to be executed automatically. The `ana.sh` (which actually calls `ana.m`) applies the calibration procedure, the random displacement of the pixels, etc. Actually all the analysis is done in this part.
7. It gives as an output, stored in `~/gate/system/devices/mingo01/data/ana`, and respectively in one of these directories: TT1, TT2 and Vars (TT stands for *trigger type*, which can be 1: coincidence or 2: self-trigger), the results. The most important files to start studying physics are those in `Vars`, which are also classified in TT1 and TT2: some `.mat` that hace two parts: outputvarplane, which is information plane by plane, and outputvartelescope, which is information of the telescope as a whole (efficiencies, for example). When `ana.m` ends calculating all this, it copies and distributes it to the rest of the parts of the telescope.
