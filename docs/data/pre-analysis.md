## Efficiency

For this detector we are calculating the efficiency without taking into account geometric concerns.

In order to guarantee with a high degree of certainty that what we are detecting are muons, we acquire data in coincidence mode. This is, we only consider a hit a real event if it gets detected in 3 of the RPC layers, and then we look at the remaining layer.
The proportion of events that get detected in the 4 RPCs vs the events that only get detected in 3 RPCs is what we take as our efficiency. (I think???: I'll Ask Alberto)

Since we also have information of the location of the hit within the RPC, we can plot a map of efficiency for each RPC.
