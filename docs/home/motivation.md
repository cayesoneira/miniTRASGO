# Motivation
The fundamental question is the following: is it possible to measure high energy cosmic rays with only a few detectors?

The TRASGO features:

- High granularity tracking detectors (posibility to detect bundles).
- ...
- Electron enery distribution.

TRASGALDABAS and TRISTAN are big, expensive, require a lot of power... but miniTRASGO is cheaper and smaller, and could allow developing new software and techniques that could be exported to the bigger TRASGOs.
