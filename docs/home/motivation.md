# Motivation
The fundamental question is the following: **is it possible to measure high energy cosmic rays with a few small detectors?** This is the originlaity and motivation behind the miniTRASGO, but also behind the TRASGO project. Cosmic ray observatories are usually spread in a wide area (Pierre Auger, HAWK...) trying to get the most total view of the cosmic ray shower, collecting it totally. It would be interesting if we could measure only a very narrow region of the shower and extrapolate from that data the characteristics of the complete cascade, as well as the energy of the incoming primary cosmic ray.
