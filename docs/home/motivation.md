# Motivation
The fundamental question is the following: is it possible to measure high energy cosmic rays with only a few detectors?

The TRASGO features:

- High granularity tracking detector (granularity is measured in particles(event)
- Sensitive to bundles of particles
- Muon / Electron software PID
- Rough estimation of the electron energy distribution

TRAGALDABAS and TRISTAN are big, expensive, require a lot of power... but miniTRASGO is cheaper and smaller, and could allow developing new software and techniques that could be exported to the bigger TRASGOs.
