## Some history
The beginning of the TRASGO project (the -1 step, actually) comes from the HADES RPC ToF Wall, around the 2000's. LIP (Coimbra), GSI (Darmstad), IFIC (Valencia) and LabCAF (Santiago de Compostela) participated.


There have been already two TRASGO meetings and two TRAGALDABAS meetings.
