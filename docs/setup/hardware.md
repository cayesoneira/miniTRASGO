## Geometry of the telescope

- 4 parallel square RPC detectors (fig. 1):
    - Active area: 30x30 cm
    - Three 2 mm thick glass panes separated by 1 mm thick nylon monofilaments (fig. 2).
    - Two gaps of 1mm each filled with gas Freon (R134a).
    - Top and bottom glass panes covered with semiconducting paint on the inside.
    - High voltage applied between the paint layers (positive / negative).
    - 4 metal strips cover each RPC on top (fig. 3):
        - Asymmetrical widths.
        - 2 outputs: front and back.
- Discrimination electronics on one corner
- Trigger, DAQ, Control and Monitoring electronics in box between detectors 1 and 2.
- High voltage power supply box between detectors 2 and 3.
- Independent Freon gas tank, injected with calibrated holes + flow-monitors in the output (mutom like) + common bubbler.

## Electronics

General diagram: see fig. 5.

(MB: motherboard; DB: daighterboard; FEE: front-end electronics)

The FEE electronics are composed by:
- DB: the daughterboard includes in a Hidronav piece with all the components on one side the main electronics to turn the signal generated by the RPC into a LVDS (Low Voltage Differential signal). It has a discriminator, etc.
- MB: the motherboard gives power from a special power source (the one that we only have one more piece of and Alberto handmaded one that is going to test) to the DBs and also communicates the DB signals to the TRB. That power source needs to have 20 W, but doubling it to 40 W is recommended to cover some errors that could kill the chips in the circuit in case the current stops flowing and the condensers still accumulate charge.

The mingo has a web board that allows the direct communication with the TRB even though the overall system is not connected to the internet. For example in the FEE test setup we do not have that web board so we need a router to connect TRB and PC aside to the internet and then one to another.

- Eight DABC discrimination DB (fig. 4) + control MB:
    - 4 input channels
    - Input: analog signal from the detector strips (MMCX connectors).
    - Output: square signal. Length proportional to charge deposited (32 pin connector).
    - Developed for the HADES detector (GSI).
- TRB3sc board [Documentation](http://jspc29.x-matter.uni-frankfurt.de/docu/trb3docu.pdf):
    - Trigger selection and signal digitization.
    - 32 TDCs
    - Inputs: square LVDS (low voltage differential signal) from the DABC boards (2x 16 pin connectors).
    - Outputs: digital timestamp and length of each square signal (USB).
- ODroid Single Board Computer (SBC): General control and LAN communication.
- Solid State Drive (SSD): Data storage.
- High Voltage power supply:
    - Common for all detectors.
    - Software controlled.
    - Positive and negative voltages.
    - I2C protocol.
- Enviroment sensors:
    - One inside the electronics box, one outside.
    - Temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity.
    - I2C protocol.
- Flow meters:
    - Gas flow monitoring.
    - I2C protocol.
- Low voltage power supply for the electronics:
    - Input: 48 V
    - Outputs: 12 V, 30? V
- Watchdog: ensures the electronics are turned on continuously.
