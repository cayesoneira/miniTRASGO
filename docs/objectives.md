# Objectives
Currently out objectives could be divided into realistic and more dreamy ones.

## Realistic
- Extract a cosmic ray rate. We could try to see a Forbush Decrease (A Forbush decrease is a rapid decrease in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity following a coronal mass ejection (CME). It occurs due to the magnetic field of the plasma solar wind sweeping some of the galactic cosmic rays away from Earth.). Just like that. We would need to clean the data, etc
