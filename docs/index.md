# Welcome to the miniTRASGO documentation
Here everything necessary to use the miniTRASGO (miniature TRacking ...) cosmic ray (CR) is found. We split this page in several parts including hardware and software.

## The logbook
We encourage the miniTRASGO user to keep track any activity it develops on any of the miniTRASGO in the following logbook made in Google Sheets: [miniTRASGO logbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12n6DfQ32oXcRKpHaolfAoO3pKVVrrWzk7TBOIZ0N6ro/edit?usp=sharing).
