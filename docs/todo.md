# To do list:
- Find the plateau: study the behaviour of the efficiency with the high voltage (HV). We are around 5.5 kV.
- See how temperature, humidity, pressure affect the detector.
- Study the gas flow: if it is equal, if it decreases with time, which is the optimal value of flux (to save gas if possible).
- Document all data and software.
- See if an autocalibration software exists; else, write it. It should use three layers to calibrate the fourth for every layer.
- Write a visual interface for controlling the voltage, seeing the temperature, etc.
- Investigate why some strips appear larger.
- See if it is interesting that some strips are wider than others.
- Avoid if possible the rel√© for the future
- Check the Alberto's power supply. If it works we will not need to change dramatically the architexture for future mingos.
