# To do list:
- Find the voltage plateau: study the behaviour of the efficiency with the high voltage (HV). We are around 5.5 kV.
- See how temperature, humidity, pressure affect the detector.
- Study the gas flow: if it is equal, if it decreases with time, which is the optimal value of flux (to save gas if possible).
- Document all data and software.
- See if an autocalibration software exists; else, write it. It should use three layers to calibrate the fourth for every layer.
- Write a visual interface for controlling the voltage, seeing the temperature, etc.
- See if it is interesting that some strips are wider than others in terms of resolution.
- See if it is interesting that the strips are crossed every layer, and even if it is interesting that they are of different shapes (just like the Coimbra RPC).
- Avoid if possible the rel√© for the future.
- Check the Alberto's power supply. If it works we will not need to change dramatically the architexture for future mingos.
- Calibrate mingo offset on time difference to obtain a realistic position of the event.
- Try to guess some physics we could learn from mingo.
- Recalculate the velocity of propagation of the signal on the strip

# To understand:
- The wide strip does get more counts in the first layer (upper one): is this ok? why? *Could it be that because of being at the edge the fact of being wider does not five advantage?*
- Investigate why some strips appear larger.
- See why some random maxima in temperature are correlated with maxima at the muon detection. In words of Alberto, *sometimes the detector has a general offset*. We still do not know where it comes from.
