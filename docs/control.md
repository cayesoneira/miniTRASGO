# Control indicators:
- The correlation between the charge measured back and forth in the same strip has to be close to 1 (a plot helps to visualize).
- The charge, once calibrated to have its first ramp up in the histogram in 0, has to keep like this, and has to be unimodal and both back and forth charges have to be simiral in shape. (This control condition is similar to that before).
- Charge spectra are useful. If everything is going fine
- La uniformidad de la distribuci√≥n espacial de la carga es un criterio de control
- The correlation between times measured back and forth, seen in a plot, can give hints on problems. We could see gaps and different angles to 45 degrees. The thicker the dispersion, the larger the strip. And a slope different to 45 degrees indicates that there is some kind of scalating acting on the large of the strip. One of the clocks might be slower?
- The information from the self-trigger: the automatic measure of all the events from the detector.
