# Control indicators:
- The correlation between the charge measured back and forth in the same strip has to be close to 1 (a plot helps to visualize).
- The charge, once calibrated to have its first ramp up in the histogram in 0, has to keep like this, and has to be unimodal and both back and forth charges have to be simiral in shape. (This control condition is similar to that before).
