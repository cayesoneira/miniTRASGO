# Objectives
Currently our objectives could be divided into realistic and more optimistic ones. We also include a more free, dreamy category.

## Realistic

### *Extract a cosmic ray rate*
We could try to see a Forbush Decrease (a rapid decrease in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity following a coronal mass ejection (CME). It occurs due to the magnetic field of the plasma solar wind sweeping some of the galactic cosmic rays away from Earth. Wikipedia. Last FD was in June 2015. Solar maximum is estimated in 2025, so it is a good time to check for this stuff). Just like that. We would need to clean the data, etc. and also to account for changes in temperature and so on.

### *Extract a directional cosmic ray rate*.
Using the tracking information we can reconstruct a directional rate.

 
## Optimistic

### General stuff
Day-night modulation

### Cosmic ray particle identification and spectroscopy
Calculate the incident energy with the multiplicity of the event using a lead plate above. The coupling function gives the probability that a certain bundle of particles was produced by a primary CR of a certain mass and energy. This means that detecting a bundle of two muos will mean that there is a certain probability that the primary CR was a proton with >10 GeV. This would mean, in other words, **that we could detect primary CR from the ground**.

### Earth weather
Temperature of the strastosphere as a function of the muon rate at ground level.

### Solar weather
Detect Bartle's rotation (27 day long Sun cycle); AMS in ISS did detect this. It would be a success to do it from the ground.

## Ramble

### High altitude analysis
There could be a miniTRASGO in the cargo container that the IFIC is going to use for HENSA in Sierra Nevada, since they have some space there.

### Muon tomography
Use mingo directional properties to be a small tomograph (mines and other structures).
