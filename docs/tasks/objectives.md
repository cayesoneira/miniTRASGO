# Objectives
Currently out objectives could be divided into realistic and more dreamy ones.

## Realistic

- *Extract a cosmic ray rate*. We could try to see a Forbush Decrease (a rapid decrease in the observed galactic cosmic ray intensity following a coronal mass ejection (CME). It occurs due to the magnetic field of the plasma solar wind sweeping some of the galactic cosmic rays away from Earth. Wikipedia. Solar maximum is estimated in 2025, so it is a good time to check for this stuff). Just like that. We would need to clean the data, etc. and also to account for changes in temperature and so on. This could be done by two ways, hardware and software. The hardware way uses a measure of temperature in real time to guess the optimal HV and aplies it at the moment. The software way uses the measure of the efficiency to, after the measures at a given, constant temperature, correct the measured rates to the real ones.

## Dreamy

- Calculate the incident energy with the multiplicity of the event using a lead plate above.
