# Objectives
Currently our objectives could be divided into realistic and more optimistic ones. We also include a more free, dreamy category.

## Realistic

### Extract a cosmic ray rate
A clean, general, non-directional rate of cosmic rays.

### Extract a directional cosmic ray rate
Using the tracking information we can reconstruct a directional rate.

 
## Optimistic

### Cosmic ray physics
- **Particle identification and spectroscopy**. Calculate the incident energy with the multiplicity of the event using a lead plate above. Any event in the gap would result in the discharge of a few electrons. However, the High Voltage (HV) amplifies this charge to a significant level, which can be measured regardless of the original particle's energy. In an ideal scenario (a dream-like situation), during high multiplicity events, it might be possible to collect multiples of the charge typically deposited by a single particle. By determining the total charge and dividing it by the standard charge deposited by a single particle, we could estimate the number of particles involved in that event. To achieve this, we can take advantage of the fact that we have a detector with two-sided detected strips. One side of the detector would be configured with an extensive dynamic range to measure a substantial amount of charge, not just the usual charge deposited by an individual particle (the other side would function as usual). Hans' proposed idea involves placing a lead layer above the detector. By studying the multiplicity of the electrons and secondary particles generated in the lead, which will subsequently enter the detector, we can apply the aforementioned method to estimate the energy of the original particle that struck the lead.
- The coupling function gives the probability that a certain bundle of particles was produced by a primary CR of a certain mass and energy. This means that detecting a bundle of two muons will mean that there is a certain probability that the primary CR was a proton with >10 GeV. This would mean, in other words, **that we could detect primary CR from the ground**.
- Variations in the total cosmic ray background rate.

### Earth physics
- **Earth weather**. Temperature of the strastosphere as a function of the muon rate at ground level.
- Day-night modulation-
- Variations in the earth's magnetic field.


### Solar weather
Detect Bartle's rotation (27 day long Sun cycle); AMS in ISS did detect this. It would be a success to do it from the ground.

## Ramble

### Modularity
Detectors can easily be networked, synchronized, to cover larger surfaces.

### High altitude analysis
There could be a miniTRASGO in the cargo container that the IFIC is going to use for HENSA in Sierra Nevada, since they have some space there.

### Muon tomography
Use mingo directional properties to be a small tomograph (mines and other structures).
