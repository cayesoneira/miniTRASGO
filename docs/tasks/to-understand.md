## To understand:
- See why some random maxima in temperature are correlated with maxima at the muon detection. In words of Alberto, *sometimes the detector has a general offset*. We still do not know where it comes from.
- In general the thinner strips have not all the same counts, when they should. Only the thicker strip should have more counts (a 50\% more).
- The voltages applied diverge with time one from the other. It does not seem like a problem, but we do not know why.
- The layers measure different mean rates, and it is a behavior that it has been seen in other RPC detectors here at Coimbra: it was always associated with the age of the detector, since older RPCs measure generally less in self-trigger (we say that they have less noise; **we should check also if they measure only less noise or just less measures in general**), but for this detector everything was built roughly at the same time. It could be that some layers affect the others. The thing is that we see the **second upper layer** has the highest ratio, which does not make much sense. **We should measure with the detector put upside down to see if this is physical or if it is a detector-related effect**.

## Questions
- What is the time resolution inside a strip?
- How to measure the velocity of the signal inside a strip?
- How long does it take for a muon to cross miniTRASGO?
