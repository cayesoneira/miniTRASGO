The multiplication in charge in RPCs is usually 10^6 from ionization to the collection. RPC detectors have several unique and important practical features, such as good spark protection and excellent time resolution, even down to few tens of picoseconds.</p> <p>One of the fundamental parameters of RPC detectors is the Townsend first parameter: alpha = 1/lambda.</p> <p>The thicker the gap, the higher the efficiency, since there is more distance for the avalanche to grow and become noticeable. The problem: bigger gaps require larger times for the ions to be collected (microseconds to travel a 1-2 mm gap), and also, since there is more charge involved in the processes, more charge could acumulate on the glass layers with no time to get automatically dispersed/evacuated through the surface, and hence reaching the initial state, so there would be a nominal electric field affected by these charges that would be smaller than the one desired. In other words: great time precision requires thinner gaps. This motivated the idea of the multiple gap in an attemp to reach the efficiency of a thick gap without losing other properties. Actually minGO has 2 gaps that would allow to reach the 90% in efficiency.</p> <p>There are two types of RPCs: those with 1-2 mm gaps, that are useful only for triggering and have around 1 ns of time resolution (minGO is one of those) and those called timing RPCs that have 50 ps of time resolution: these are more complicated because require gas mixing and very high electric fields, which make them delicate detectors.</p> <p>One of the plates must necessarily be resistive (also both could be), and approximately 10^12 ohms/cm to stop undesired avalanches that would create sparks that could kill the electronics. A resistivity that is too big would not allow any detection at all. The resistivity comes from the glass, the conductivity (to establish the field) comes from the paint (an acrilic, artistic, painter, paint: for some reason the manufacturer gives the resistivity as technical specification).</p> <p>The gas that miniTRASGO uses is F134a, usually found in refrigerator units. The name is 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroetane and it does not hurt the Ozone layer, but it is a greenhouse effect gas. The new european(?) laws discourage its use and require special protocols for its treatment, which is making the refrigerator manufacturers to stop its use and therefore creating a surpluss that is making it cheaper for us to buy.</p> <p></p> <p>Some RPCs at Coimbra are said to be gasless: this means that it has ionizing gas, of course, but that it is a closed cage that does not need to be refilled in a constant gas flux. Some voices claim that the gas properties might be lost in high particle flux regime due to creation of free radicals, etc. but the fact is that for now (July 14th, 2023) they have used a really big RPC (more than 1 m * 1 m) for Cosmic Ray detection and no efficienty loss is seen.

This means that to obtain a reliable charge spectrum, that will be different in shape in AU and in C, we will need the transformation to Coulombs. All this question comes from the method from which the LVDS width is created.</p> <p>There are different methods to get a LVDS width from the original RPC signal. For example using the integrated signal: we could measure eventually at a relatively long time the maximum height to know the total charge. This method is slow, since the integrated signal just reaches a top that later has to be lowered. The lowering of the signal is so slow that the dead time is very high.</p> <p>Other usual technique is the TOT (Time over Threshold), which is a method that gets the width of the LVDS according to how much time the charge signal is over a certain discriminator. Since the shape of the charge respect to time is presumably dependent only on the total charge (meaning that total integrated value, amplitude and shape are directly related), we can guess the total height of the signal from the width at a certain height. According to the type of signal to which we are applying the TOT, we can classify: - Standard: just the regular Q vs. time function. - Integrated and derivated: the signal is integrated and at the same time it is derivated so it would be overall thicker than the original RPC signal but it is thick enough to allow the TOT to apply. The speed of the derivation (which lowers the signal) determines why it is called fast electronics; the faster the better, even though there is a handicap in lowering the signal to fast: THE same charge avalanche inside the RPC could be measured twice as two different, independent signals, and this is because the ions take microseconds to totally get to the strip: they are much slower than the electronics. This has to be solved if we want faster electronics, but some filters could work. From the TOT and knowing the method we apply to modify the signal we can eventually derive a value for the charge in AU. If we can get the charge calibration curve we can transform from charge in AU (arbitrary units) to those of proper charge: Coulombs. And the transformation is non-linear, so it will slightly change the spectrum shape.</p> <p>Here we include the FEE calibration setup to obtain the time-to-charge calibration curve.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"operation/configuration/","title":"Preparing the minGO","text":"<p>The <code>crontab</code> is configured to automatically execute the needed software when rebooting the system.

Calculate the incident energy with the multiplicity of the event using a lead plate above. Any event in the gap would result in the discharge of a few electrons. However, the High Voltage (HV) amplifies this charge to a significant level, which can be measured regardless of the original particle's energy. In an ideal scenario (a dream-like situation), during high multiplicity events, it might be possible to collect multiples of the charge typically deposited by a single particle. By determining the total charge and dividing it by the standard charge deposited by a single particle, we could estimate the number of particles involved in that event. To achieve this, we can take advantage of the fact that we have a detector with two-sided detected strips. One side of the detector would be configured with an extensive dynamic range to measure a substantial amount of charge, not just the usual charge deposited by an individual particle (the other side would function as usual). Hans' proposed idea involves placing a lead layer above the detector. By studying the multiplicity of the electrons and secondary particles generated in the lead, which will subsequently enter the detector, we can apply the aforementioned method to estimate the energy of the original particle that struck the lead.</li> <li>The coupling function gives the probability that a certain bundle of particles was produced by a primary CR of a certain mass and energy.
