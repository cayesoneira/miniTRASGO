## Deployment Process: For Repository Owners Only

The deployment of the documentation is **handled exclusively by the repository owners**. Contributors do not need to worry about this step. The documentation is automatically updated every hour and hosted at [http://nuc1.fis.ucm.es/minitrasgo](http://nuc1.fis.ucm.es/minitrasgo).

For reference, here are the deployment details:

### Connecting to the Deployment Server

1. **Configure SSH:** Add the following lines to your `~/.ssh/config` file:
   ```bash
   Host nuclab2
       HostName nuclab2.fis.ucm.es
       User petgfn
       PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
       HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
       KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
   Host nuc1
       Hostname nuc1.fis.ucm.es
       User petgfn
   ```

2. **Connect to `nuc1` through `nuclab2` as a tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ssh -J nuclab2 nuc1
   ```

3. **Deploy the updated site:**
   ```bash
   sudo /home/www/html/update-minitrasgo.sh
   ```
